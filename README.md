This simple web app is built with Vue.JS. The app entry points are ```src/main.js``` and ```src/App.vue```,
but most of the business logic in ```src/components/SpringfieldBody.vue```. To mock an API, signups are
stored in and fetched from localStorage.

There are some simple unit tests in the ```test/unit``` folder. To run them, run ```npm run test``` from the root folder.
